StumbleTube presents YouTube recommendations (pulled from your Google account) in a fashion thatâ€™s easy to quickly traverse. You get videos in sets of four - hovering over a video plays only the audio from that video, and clicking on one makes that video full-screen. At any point, you can pick a different video, or request a new set of four. You can also like videos to further improve recommendations.

StumbleTube has a bonus feature, which lets you control the entire player exclusively from your phone.
